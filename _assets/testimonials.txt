Thereâ€™s nobody as good as Tim at what he does.  Working on an independent feature with high expectations on a limited budget, practical locations were a big part of our vision and story.  Tim Grady, as our Location Scout and Manager, was essential.  He scouted and managed 20 locations over our 29-day shoot, from the boardwalks of Myrtle Beach to the shores of Bull Island (accessible only by boat).  Tim knew the perfect spots for what we needed, and how to make sure everything was taken care of.  The film is noted for its beauty and production value, which had everything to do with Tim and our locations.

It was truly a pleasure to work with Tim and Ebb & Flow on our recent Smithsonian Channel documentary "Lincoln's Last Day."  His expert knowledge, personal relationships, creativity and professionalism opened the door to Charleston, where we staged a 1865 Washington DC that looked like a million bucks.  We look forward to more collaborations in the future!

"I've worked with Tim and Ebb & Flow on locations for the last (how many, over 10 right??) years. He's not only the best in the region, but the best I've ever worked with. Service is above and beyond expectations every time, both in procuring locations and managing those locations, as well as effortlessly providing "value-added" services at a moment's notice. Especially good at securing sensitive and hard-to-get locations for trustworthy clients. Thanks Tim, can't wait to work with you again!"
